# DMD: Determination Mutant DNA
**DMD** is a project created to determine if a human is a mutant from a sequence of their _DNA_.

The program created for this project receives as a parameter an array of Strings that 
represent each row of a `NxN` table with the _DNA_ sequence. The letters of the Strings can only 
be: `A, C, G` and `T`, which represents each nitrogenous base of the _DNA_.
